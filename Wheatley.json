You're the LAST test subject left. And if you DON'T help me, we're both going to die. Alright? I didn't want to say it, you dragged it out of me. Alright? Dead.

Hello?","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_openingyouallright01.mp3"},{"text":"Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension.

'Apple'.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_openingbraindamageapplenag04.mp3"},{"text":"How would you use it in a sentence? 'Mmm, this apple's crunchy,' you might say.

Get ready...","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_openingwall01.mp3"},{"text":"Good news: that is NOT a docking station. So there's one mystery solved. I'm going to attempt a manual override on this wall. Could get a bit technical! Hold on!","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_openingwallhitone02.mp3"},{"text":"Almost there!

I wanted to talk to you for a moment, if I may.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech02.mp3"},{"text":"I'll be honest: The death traps have been a bit of a failure so far. For both of us. I think you'll agree. And you are getting very close to my lair.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech03.mp3"},{"text":"'Lair' - heh, weird isn't it? First time I've said it out loud. Sounds a bit ridiculous, really. But I can assure you it is one. It is a proper lair. Deadly lair.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech04.mp3"},{"text":"And I just wanted to give you the chance to kill yourself now. Before you get to the lair. You can just jump into the masher, just there. Less a death trap, more a death option for you.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech05.mp3"},{"text":"Sounds crazy, I know. But hear me out. Once you get to my lair, death will not be optional. It will be mandatory. No tricks, no surprises: just you dying, as a result of me killing you in a very very gruesome way.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech06.mp3"},{"text":"So. Boom. Better offer here is just kill yourself. Seems like a lot of effort to walk all the way to my deadly lair, when there's a perfectly serviceable death option right there. Again: not a death trap. Your death would be entirely voluntary. And very much appreciated.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech07.mp3"},{"text":"The masher does work. I should point that out. I know we've had a couple of problems in the past. This masher definitely works and it will kill you. If that's one of your concerns about jumping in, the masher will kill you. Painless. Well, it won't be painless, obviously. But it will mash you up.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech08.mp3"},{"text":"In summary: walk all the way to certain doom, or give up now. Honorably. Like a samurai! Save yourself a trip. It's win-win for you.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech09.mp3"},{"text":"Plus, I put a lot of effort in getting this lair ready for you. It'd certainly teach me a lesson if you simply died, painlessly, twenty feet from the door. I'd be furious. I'd be like RRRRR. I got my just desserts. No more than I deserve. Why not teach me a lesson by jumping in the old masher?","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech10.mp3"},{"text":"I tell you, if I was up against impossible odds, this is the way I'd want to go out: mashed with dignity. That'd be the way I'd choose.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech11.mp3"},{"text":"And here's the best part. There's a conveyor belt that will convey you in convenient comfort right into the masher. You won't have to lift a finger. Everything's been taken care of. Didn't have to. Didn't have to do that.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech12.mp3"},{"text":"Look, anyway. I've spoken enough. Take your time. I'll let you think about it. I don't want to pressure you: is it the lair? Is it the masher? You know what my opinion is: Masher. I'm leaning toward masher. Up to you. Just gonna give you some time to think","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_speech13.mp3"},{"text":"Oh! Wow! Good! I didn't think that was going to work.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_playerdies01.mp3"},{"text":"Okay, I'll take that as a no, then. Fine. Well. May the best man win. Sphere. May the best sphere win. Swap that in. Much more clever. Books.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_escape01.mp3"},{"text":"Okay, I'll take that as a no, then.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale03_escape02.mp3"},{"text":"Well, well, well. Welcome to MY LAIR! Lemme just flag something up: According to the control panel light up there, the entire building's going to self destruct in about six minutes. I'm pretty sure it's a problem with the light. I think the light's on the blink. But just in case it isn't, I'm actually going to have to kill you, as discussed earlier.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_introb01.mp3"},{"text":"So, let's call that three minutes, and then a minute break, which should leave a leisurely two minutes to figure out how to shut down whatever's starting all the fires. So anyway, that's the itinerary.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_introb02.mp3"},{"text":"Also, I took the liberty of watching the tapes of you killing her, and I'm not going to make the same mistakes.

Leading directly into number Four: Bombs. For throwing at you.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_intro_all04.mp3"},{"text":"You know what, this plan is so good, I'm going to give you a sporting chance and turn off the neurotoxin. I'm joking. Of course. Goodbye.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_intro_all05.mp3"},{"text":"Where are you going? Don't run! Don't run! I'll tell you why you shouldn't run: The harder you breathe, the more neurotoxin you'll inhale. It's bloody clever, this stuff. Seriously, it's devilish.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_bombtaunts01.mp3"},{"text":"Still running. Alright. Looks tiring. Tell you what - you stop running and I'll stop bombing you... That seems fair.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_bombtaunts02.mp3"},{"text":"Alright. Didn't go for that, I see. Knew I was lying. Point to you. But you still are inhaling neurotoxin. So, point deducted.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_bombtaunts03.mp3"},{"text":"Look out! I'm right behind you! No, of course I'm not. Saw through that one as well. Forty feet tall, right in front of you. Not my greatest ruse. To be honest. Still a giant robot, though. Look at that.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_bombtaunts11.mp3"},{"text":"Ohp! Where are you going? Nowhere. Not going anywhere. Alright? Got you trapped like a little jumpsuited rat.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak01.mp3"},{"text":"Oh, did you bring your little portal gun? There's nothing to portal onto here, luv. Just ten pounds of dead weight. About to be two hundred and ten. Fatty.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak02.mp3"},{"text":"You're just delaying the inevitable, alright? You cannot run from my bombs forever. Well, you can if I keep aiming them poorly. But I'll get better as we go, and you'll just get tired.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak03.mp3"},{"text":"This would go a lot faster if you'd stay still. Then I'd have time to fix the facility. So one of us at least would live. No need to be selfish, luv, you're gonna die.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak05.mp3"},{"text":"I should congratulate you, by the way. I didn't actually think you'd make such a worthy opponent. Weren't you supposed to be brain damaged or something? Yeah, brain damaged like a fox.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak06.mp3"},{"text":"Remember when I first told you how to find that little portal thing you love so much? Well, I thought you'd die on the way, if I'm honest. All the others did.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak07.mp3"},{"text":"You didn't think you were the first, did you? [laughs] No no no. Fifth. No, I lie: Sixth. Perhaps it's best to leave it to your imagination what happened to the other five...","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak08.mp3"},{"text":"You know what? I think we're well past the point of tasteful restraint. So I'll tell you what happened to them: they died. Horrifically. They all died horrifically. Trying to get that portal device that you're gripping in your meaty little fingers there.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak09.mp3"},{"text":"Oh but you were different weren't you? You were such a good jumper. Problem solver. Clever. But ambitious. You see, ambitious. That's your Achilles Heel. Mine's-oh! Oh! Almost told you. Clever, clever girl. Again: brain damaged like a fox, you.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak10.mp3"},{"text":"We've had some times, haven't we? Like that time I jumped off my management rail, not sure if I'd die or not when I did, and all you had to do was catch me? Annnd you didn't. Did you? Oh, you remember that? I remember that. I remember that all the time.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak11.mp3"},{"text":"And we could have talked our way out of it. Except you forgot to tell me that you'd murdered her. And that she needed you to live, so the only available vent for her rage would be good old crushable Wheatley. Yeah. Little details that I remember. Easy little tidbits you could have used to save me from getting crushed if you'd cared, which you didn't, obviously. And still do not.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak12.mp3"},{"text":"Oh, remember the time I took over the facility? Greatest moment of my life, but you just wanted to leave. Didn't want to share in my success. Well, so you know, I would be happy for you if you succeeded. Apart from right now, obviously.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak13.mp3"},{"text":"Am I being too vague? I despise you. I loathe you. You arrogant, smugly quiet, awful jumpsuited monster of a woman. You and your little potato friend. This place would have been a triumph if it wasn't for you!","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_finale04_pre_pipebreak14.mp3"},{"text":"No! Don't! No! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_whitegel_break01.mp3"},{"text":"Ha... That sounded real. No! That was actually an impression of you. Actually. Because you just fell into my trap. My brilliant trap. Just then. I wanted you to trick me into bursting that pipe. You didn't trick me. Seemingly trick me. To give you false hope. Because, that leads to overconfidence. And that leads to mistakes. Fatal mistakes. And it's all part of my plan.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_whitegel_break02.mp3"},{"text":"Ah, but I just... I have actually made my actual first mistake... by telling you my plan. Just now. Grrr... It's me old Achilles Heel again. Armed with that knowledge, I imagine you won't even use the conversion gel. Oh fate! Oh cruel mistress.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_whitegel_break03.mp3"},{"text":"That conversion gel has been sitting in that pipe going stagnant for years. You'll probably get botulism portalling through it like that.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_whitegel_break05.mp3"},{"text":"And you'll probably get ringworm.

Clearly.","url":"http://files.bo0tzz.me/mp3/Wheatley/Wheatley_bw_a4_finale04_wakeupa05.mp3"},{"text":"Did you put a virus in them? It's not going to work either. Alright? I've got a firewall, mate.
